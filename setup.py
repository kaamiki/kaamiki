Kaamiki

A Python based implementation of kaamiki.

Kaamiki is a simple cross-platform automation framework for data
science and machine learning tasks. It is an operating system agnostic
Artificial Intelligence development package which provides high-level
and flexible python abstractions for running simple machine learning
applications.
Kaamiki also offers python based nifty tools such as logger, file I/O
related functions, etc. which provides an extension to the developers
existing work.
