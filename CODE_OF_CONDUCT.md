![Code of Conduct](https://github.com/xames3/kaamiki/blob/assets/elements/img/code-of-conduct-banner.png?raw=true)
<h1><p align="center">Our Code of Conduct</p></h1>

We want everyone to progress in an ecosystem that empowers developers and users alike to reach their potential whilst encouraging self-growth and effective collaboration. In short, a space that is safe for all. A space which will benefit everyone that participates in the process. A space which encourages new developers to learn and enter in the world of programming.

In an effort to create such place, we are building our Code of Conduct.<br>We do not publish this because we fear an inappropriate behavior, but because we appreciate and love the extraordinary respect and values of our team and would like every contributor to respect it as well. This is through discussion and collaboration that we grow, and with our growth we improve.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, harassment-free and healthy environment for everyone, regardless of academic education and years of experience.

As community members, contributors and maintainers of this project, we are thankful and commit to respect all people who participate in the community through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

## Our standards

- We welcome and encourage participation by everyone and are committed to being in a community where everyone feels good about joining.
- We sacredly believe in the concept of **[Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam](https://www.speakingtree.in/blog/vasudhaiva-kutumbakam-meaning)** (The World is One Family) in letter and spirit. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat everyone well.
- Expected behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
  - Clearly convey what you want, avoid acronyms and jargon to keep the conversations simple. Be inclusive.
  - Be inquisitive. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early in planning and development avoids confusions later, so asking questions is encouraged. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving Kaamiki.
  - We don't encourage support and suggestions on demand, we expect everyone to be proactive. We believe in proactive help or contribution to a problem. While doing so, please be careful not to be too patronizing or disrespectful. When someone turns to you for help, always be open, listen and try to put yourself in the position of your counterpart. If you don't have time, let the person know or maybe refer to a team member who is just as familiar with the topic.
  - Share your insights early to get a quick feedback. Don't just ask for feedback, but share yours with the team as well. Your feedback should be respectful, clear, constructive, and focused on goals and values rather than personal preferences.
  - Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people. Be polite and friendly in all forms of communication. Avoid sarcasm or explicitly add a hashtag **#sarcasm** to your statement to avoid misunderstandings. If required use Emojis or GIFs to avoid miscommunication, but use them consciously and moderately.
  - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
  - Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
  - Step down considerately. Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project they should inform the community members that they are leaving and/or would be unavailable and take responsibility to ensure that others can pick up where they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those who continue to participate in the project and should not misrepresent the project's goals or achievements. Likewise, community members should respect any individual's choice to leave the project.
- Unacceptable behavior include:
  - Don't be surprised if a team member is not yet familiar with some topic, a tool, an abstract concept, a person or a process. It is absolutely okay to say, "**I don't know**" or "**I don't understand**".
  - The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances of any kind.
  - Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
  - Public or private harassment.
  - Publishing other's private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
  - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
  - Angry responses are valid, but abusive language and vindictive actions are toxic. When something happens that offends you, handle it assertively, but be respectful. Escalate reasonably, and try to allow the offender an opportunity to explain themselves, and possibly correct the issue. Also, please note that different people interpret behavior differently.

## Scope

- We believe that the mutual articulation of our values and responsibilities gives us a clear direction if there are any deviations in the future. We are all committed to implement, adhere and improvise our Code of Conduct as our team and contributors grow.
- The Code of Conduct applies in particular to team interaction, including all events hosted/conducted by Kaamiki, chat and video conferences, social media communication, pull request feedback, participation in open source projects, communication with our team at conferences or events where we represent Kaamiki, whether offline or online.

## Conflict Resolution

Conflict can happen in any form or from someone using hurtful and harsh language to more serious cases such as threats of voilence and everything in between.<br>Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably on a real-time basis. If this isn't possible, ask a mutual colleague to convey the message. If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.
  
## Reporting Violations

- If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please email us at <xames3.kaamiki@gmail.com> or create an [incident report](https://forms.gle/NRTkqQiquet821QTA).
- If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.
- We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
- In order to provide learning & growth oriented space with protection of individual and Kaamiki community from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

## Enforcement Guidelines

- Kaamiki maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to our Code of Conduct.
- A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
- If a participant engages in harassing or any other serious behavior, the Kaamiki maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Kaamiki spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Kaamiki community members or the general public.

This Code of Conduct is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals.
